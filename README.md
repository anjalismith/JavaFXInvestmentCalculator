# JavaFXInvestmentCalculator
JavaFX project for Johns Hopkins CTY's Advanced Programming in Java course. The program creates a graphical user interface in which users can calculate the future value of their investment after a certain number of years by entering the principal amount invested, the annual interest rate, and the number of years the investment has accumulated interest.
